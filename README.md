# Regression-Models-for-Stock-Forecasting
Overview

This project applies Machine Learning (Linear Regression) to predict next-day stock prices. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

Features

Loads and preprocesses stock data

Applies Linear Regression for prediction

Includes feature scaling for better accuracy

Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance

Visualizes predictions vs. actual stock prices

Requirements

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook stock_prediction.ipynb


Run all cells to preprocess data, train the model, and view results.

Results

The model predicts next-day stock prices with reasonable accuracy. Visualization shows actual vs. predicted trends for better interpretation.

Future Improvements

Use advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTMs)

Expand dataset for better accuracy

Add a simple Flask/Django web app for real-time predictions
