# Regression-Models-for-Stock-Forecasting
This project applies Machine Learning to predict student scores based on study hours. It demonstrates a supervised learning workflow using Linear Regression, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns

Linear Regression implementation with scikit-learn

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Model evaluation using RÂ², MAE, and RMSE

Visualizations for better interpretation

Tech Stack

Python

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

scikit-learn

How It Works

Import dataset of study hours and scores

Explore and visualize the data

Train a Linear Regression model

Optimize with GridSearchCV

Evaluate performance and visualize predictions

Results

Best parameter: fit_intercept=True

Strong correlation between study hours and scores

Model generalizes well for small datasets

Usage

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-score-prediction.git
cd student-score-prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the notebook to train and test the model.

Future Improvements

Add more student-related features (e.g., sleep, environment, consistency)

Compare different regression models

Deploy as a simple web app
